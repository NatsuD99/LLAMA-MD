The diſcuſsion ſtarted the general the future improvement queſtion of firſt ſociety, and the Author at of ſat down with an intention of merely ſtating his thoughts to his f riend, up- on paper, in a clearer manner than he thought he could do in converſation. But as the ſubject opened upon him, ſome ideas occurred, which he did not recollect to have met with before ; and as he conceived that every leaſt light, on a topic ſo generally intereſt- ing, might be received with candour, he determined to put his thoughts in a form for publication.\n\npreface.\n\nundoubtedly, have been rendered much more com- plete by a collection of a greater num- ber of facts in elucidation of the gen- eral argument. But a long and almoſt total interruption f rom very particular busineſs, joined to a desire (perhaps imprudent) of not delaying the pub- lication much beyond the time that he originally propoſed, prevented the Author f rom giving to the ſubject an undivided attention. He preſumes, however, that the facts which he has adduced will be found to form no in- considerable evidence for the truth of his opinion reſpecting the future im- provement of mankind. As the Au- thor this opinion at preſent, little more appears to him to be neceſſary than a plain ſtatement, in addition to the moſt curſory view of ſociety, to eſtabliſh it.\n\nThe Eſſay might,\n\ncontemplates\n\nii\n\niii\n\npreface.\n\nIt is an obvious truth, which has been taken notice of by many writers, that population muſt always be kept down to the level of the means of ſub- siſtence ; but no writer that the Au- thor recollects has inquired particu- larly into the means by which this is a view level of theſe means which forms, to his mind, the ſtrongeſt obſtacle in the way to any very great future improvement of ſociety. He hopes it will appear that, in the diſcuſsion of this intereſt- ing ſubject, he is actuated ſolely by a love of truth, and not by any preju- dices againſt any particular ſet of men, or of opinions. He profeſſes to have read ſome of the ſpeculations on the ſociety in a future improvement of temper very different f rom a wiſh to find them visionary, but he has not acquired that command over his un- derſtanding which would enable him\n\nis effected ? and it\n\npreface.\n\nto believe what he wiſhes, without ev- idence, or to refuſe his aſſent to what might be unpleasing, when accompa- nied with evidence.\n\nThe view which he has given of human life has a melancholy hue, but he feels conſcious that he has drawn theſe dark tints f rom a conviction that they are really in the picture, and not f rom a jaundiced eye or an inherent ſpleen of diſposition. The theory of mind which he has ſketched in the two laſt chapters accounts to his own underſtanding in a ſatiſfactory manner for the exiſtence of moſt of the evils of life, but whether it will have the ſame effect upon others muſt be left to the judgement of his readers.\n\nIf he ſhould ſucceed in drawing the attention of more able men to what he conceives to be the principal difficulty\n\niv\n\nv\n\npreface.\n\nin the way to the improvement of ſo- ciety and ſhould, in conſequence, ſee this difficulty removed, even in the- ory, he will gladly retract his preſent opinions, and rejoice in a conviction of his error.\n\n7 June, 1798.\n\ncon t en t s.\n\nCHAP.

Their mutual arguments do not meet with a candid examination. The queſtion is not brought to reſt on few- er points, and even in theory ſcarcely ſeems to be approaching to a decision.\n\nthis painful\n\nlight\n\nThe advocate for the preſent order of things is apt to treat the ſect of ſpeculative philoſophers either as a ſet of artful and designing knaves who\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nand preach up ardent benevolence draw captivating pictures of a happier ſtate of ſociety only the better to en- able the preſent eſtabliſhments and to forward their own deep-laid ſchemes of ambition, or as wild and mad-headed enthusiaſts whoſe silly ſpeculations and abſurd paradoxes are not worthy the attention of any reaſonable man.\n\nthem to deſtroy\n\nThe advocate for the perfectibility of man, and of ſociety, retorts on the defender of eſtabliſhments a more than equal contempt.

The really good arguments on each side of the queſtion are not allowed to have their proper weight. Each purſues his own little ſolicitous to correct or theory, improve it by an attention to what is advanced by his opponents.\n\nThe f riend of the preſent order of things condemns all political ſpecula- tions in the groſs. He will not even condeſcend to examine the grounds f rom which the perfectibility of ſoci- ety is inferred. Much leſs will he give himſelf the trouble in a fair and can- did manner to attempt an exposition of their fallacy.\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nThe ſpeculative philoſopher equally offends againſt the cauſe of truth. With eyes fixed on a happier ſtate of ſociety, the bleſsings of which he paints in the moſt captivating colours, to indulge in the he allows himſelf moſt bitter invectives againſt every preſent eſtabliſhment, without apply- ing his talents to consider the beſt and ſafeſt means of removing abuſes and without ſeeming to be aware of the tremendous obſtacles that threat- en, even in theory, to oppoſe the pro- greſs of man towards perfection.\n\nan acknowledged truth in philoſophy that a juſt theory will al- ways be confirmed by experiment.

I have been warmed and delighted with the en- chanting picture which they hold forth. I ardently wiſh for ſuch happy improvements. But I ſee great, and, to my underſtanding, unconquerable dif- ficulties in the way to them. Theſe difficulties it is my preſent purpoſe to ſtate, declaring, at the ſame time, that ſo far f rom exulting in them, as a cauſe of triumph over the f riends of inno- vation, nothing would give me greater pleaſure than to ſee them completely removed.\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nThe moſt important argument that I ſhall adduce is certainly not new. The principles on which it depends have been explained in part by Hume, and more at large by Dr Adam Smith. It has been advanced and applied to the preſent ſubject, though not with in the moſt its proper weight, or forcible point of view, by Mr. Wallace, and it may probably have been ſtated by many writers that I have never met with. I ſhould certainly therefore not think of advancing it again, though I mean to place it in a point of view in ſome degree different f rom any that I have hitherto ſeen, if it had ever been fairly and ſatiſfactorily anſwered.\n\nthis neglect on the part of the per- fectibility of mankind is not easily ac- counted for. I cannot doubt the talents ſuch men as Godwin and Con- of\n\nThe cauſe of\n\nthe advocates\n\nfor\n\n8\n\n9\n\nan essay on the\n\ndorcet. I am unwilling to doubt their candour. To my underſtanding, and probably to that of moſt others, the difficulty appears inſurmountable. Yet theſe men of acknowledged ability and penetration ſcarcely deign to notice it, and hold on their courſe in ſuch ſpeculations with unabated ardour and undiminiſhed confidence. I have cer- tainly no right to ſay that they pur- their eyes to ſuch argu- poſely ſhut ments. I ought rather to doubt the va- lidity of them, when neglected by ſuch men, however forcibly their truth may ſtrike my own mind. Yet in this reſpect it muſt be acknowledged that we are all of us too prone to err. If I ſaw a glaſs of wine repeatedly preſented to a man, and he took no notice of it, I ſhould be apt to think that he was blind or uncivil. A juſter philoſophy might teach me rather to think that my eyes deceived me and that the of-\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nfer was not really what I conceived it to be.\n\nIn entering upon the argument I muſt premiſe that I put out of the queſtion, at preſent, all mere conjec- tures, the probable realization of which cannot be inferred upon any juſt philoſophical grounds. A writer may tell me that he thinks man will ultimately become an oſtrich. I cannot properly contra- dict him. But before he can expect to bring any reaſonable perſon over to his opinion, he ought the necks of mankind have been gradual- ly elongating, that the lips have grown harder and more prominent, that the legs and feet are daily altering their ſhape, and that the hair is beginning to change into ſtubs of feathers. And till the probability of ſo wonderful a it is ſurely conversion can be ſhewn,\n\nthat\n\nis, all\n\nſuppositions,\n\nto ſhew that\n\n10\n\n11\n\nan essay on the\n\nloſt time and loſt eloquence to expa- tiate on the happineſs of man in ſuch a ſtate ; to deſcribe his powers, both of running and flying, to paint him in a condition where all narrow lux- uries would be contemned, where he would be employed only in collect- ing the neceſſaries of life, and where, conſequently, of labour would be light, and his portion of leiſure ample.\n\neach man’s ſhare\n\nI think I may fairly make two poſ-\n\ntulata.\n\nFirſt, That food is neceſſary to the\n\nexiſtence of man.\n\nSecondly, That the paſsion between the ſexes is neceſſary and will remain nearly in its preſent ſtate.\n\nTheſe two laws, ever since we have had any knowledge of mankind, ap-\n\nprinciple of population.\n\npear to have been fixed laws of our na- ture, and, as we have not hitherto ſeen any alteration in them, we have no right to conclude that they will ever ceaſe to be what they now are, with- out an immediate act of power in that Being who firſt arranged the ſyſtem of the univerſe, and for the advantage of his creatures, ſtill executes, according to fixed laws, all its various operations.\n\nI do not know that any writer has ſuppoſed that on this earth man will ultimately be able to live without food. But Mr. Godwin has conjectured that the paſsion between the ſexes may in time be extinguiſhed. As, however, he calls this part of his work a deviation into the land of conjecture, I will not dwell longer upon it at preſent than to ſay that the beſt arguments for the perfectibility of man are drawn f rom a contemplation of the great progreſs\n\n12\n\n13\n\nan essay on the\n\nthat he has already made f rom the ſav- age ſtate and the difficulty of ſaying where he is to ſtop. But towards the extinction of the paſsion between the ſexes, no progreſs whatever has hith- erto been made. It appears to exiſt in as much force at preſent as it did two thouſand or four thouſand years ago. There are individual exceptions now as there always have been. But, as theſe exceptions do not appear to increaſe in number, it would ſurely be a very un- philoſophical mode of arguing to infer, merely f rom the exiſtence of an ex- ception, that the exception would, in time, become the rule, and the rule the exception.\n\nas Aſſuming then, my poſtulata granted, I ſay, that the power of pop- ulation is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce ſubsiſ- tence for man.\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nin- Population, when unchecked, creaſes in a geometrical ratio.

A ſlight acquaintance with num- bers will ſhew the immensity of the firſt power in compariſon of the ſe- cond.\n\nlaw of our nature which makes food neceſſary to the life of man, the effects of theſe two unequal powers muſt be kept equal.\n\nBy that\n\nThis implies a ſtrong and conſtantly operating check on population f rom the difficulty of ſubsiſtence. This dif- ficulty muſt fall ſomewhere and muſt neceſſarily be ſeverely felt by a large portion of mankind.\n\nThrough the animal and vegetable ſcattered the kingdoms, nature has ſeeds of life abroad with the moſt pro-\n\n14\n\n15\n\nan essay on the\n\nfuſe and liberal hand. She has been comparatively ſparing in the room and to rear the nouriſhment neceſſary them. The germs of exiſtence con- tained in this ſpot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the years. courſe Neceſsity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, reſtrains them within the preſcribed bounds. The race of plants and the race of animals ſhrink under this great reſtrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of f rom it. Among plants and animals its effects are waſte of ſeed, sickneſs, and premature death. Among mankind, miſery and vice. The abſolutely is former, miſery, neceſſary conſequence of it. Vice is a highly probable conſequence, and we therefore ſee it abundantly prevail, but it ought not, perhaps, to be called an\n\nof\n\na\n\nfew thouſand\n\nreaſon,\n\neſcape\n\nan\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nabſolutely neceſſary conſequence. The ordeal of virtue is to resiſt all tempta- tion to evil.\n\ninequality of the two powers of population and of produc- tion in the earth, and that great law of our nature which muſt conſtantly keep their effects equal, form the great dif- ficulty that to me appears inſurmount- able in the way to the perfectibili- ty of ſociety.

We will begin with it under its preſent ſtate of cultivation.\n\nIf I allow that by the beſt poſsible policy, by breaking up more land and by great encouragements to agricul- ture, the produce of this Iſland may be doubled in the firſt twenty-five years, I think it will be allowing as much as any perſon can well demand.\n\nIn the next twenty-five years, it is impoſsible to ſuppoſe that the produce could be quadrupled. It would be con-\n\nprinciple of population.\n\ntrary to all our knowledge of the qual- ities of land. The very utmoſt that we can conceive, is, that the increaſe in the ſecond twenty-five years might equal the preſent produce. Let us then take this for our rule, though certainly far beyond the truth, and allow that, by great exertion, the whole produce of the Iſland might be increaſed every twenty-five years, by a quantity of ſub- it at preſent to what siſtence equal produces. The moſt enthusiaſtic ſpecu- lator cannot ſuppoſe a greater increaſe than this. In a few centuries it would make every acre of land in the Iſland like a garden.\n\nYet this ratio of increaſe is evidently\n\narithmetical.\n\nIt may be fairly ſaid, therefore, that the means of ſubsiſtence increaſe in an\n\n22\n\n23\n\nan essay on the\n\narithmetical ratio. Let us now bring the effects of theſe two ratios together.\n\nthe Iſland is computed to be about ſeven millions, and we will ſuppoſe the preſent pro- duce equal to the ſupport of ſuch a number. In the firſt twenty-five years the population would be fourteen mil- lions, and the food being alſo doubled, ſubsiſtence would be the means of In the next increaſe. equal to this twenty-five population the would be twenty-eight millions, and the means of ſubsiſtence only equal to the ſupport of twenty-one millions. In the next period, the population would be fifty-six millions, and the means of ſubsiſtence juſt ſufficient for half that number. And at the conclusion of the firſt century the population would be one hundred and twelve millions and ſubsiſtence only equal the means of\n\nThe population of\n\nyears\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nto the ſupport of thirty-five millions, which would leave a population of ſeventy-ſeven millions totally unpro- vided for.\n\nA great emigration neceſſarily im- plies unhappineſs of ſome kind or oth- er in the country that is deſerted.

If the ſubsiſtence for man that the earth\n\nBut\n\n24\n\n25\n\nan essay on the\n\nincreaſed every affords was twenty-five years by a quantity equal the whole world at preſent to what produces, this would allow the power of production in the earth to be abſo- lutely unlimited, and its ratio of in- creaſe much greater than we can con- ceive that any poſsible exertions of mankind could make it.\n\nto be\n\nTaking the population of the world at any number, a thouſand millions, for inſtance, the human ſpecies would increaſe in the ratio of—1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, &c. and ſub- siſtence as —1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &c. In two centuries and a quarter, the population would be to the means of ſubsiſtence as 512 to 10 ? in three centuries as 4096 to 13, and in two thouſand years the difference would be though the pro- almoſt incalculable,\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nduce in that time would have increaſed to an immenſe extent.\n\nNo limits whatever are placed to the productions of the earth ; they may increaſe for ever and be greater than any aſsignable quantity, yet ſtill the power of population being a power of a ſuperior order, the increaſe of the human ſpecies can only be kept com- menſurate to the increaſe of the means of ſubsiſtence by the conſtant opera- tion of the ſtrong law of neceſsity act- ing as a check upon the greater power.\n\nThe effects of now to be considered.\n\nthis check remain\n\nAmong plants and animals the view of the ſubject is simple. They are all impelled by a powerful inſtinct to the increaſe of their ſpecies, and this inſt- inct is interrupted by no reaſoning or\n\n26\n\n27\n\nan essay on the\n\ndoubts about providing for their of- fſpring. Wherever therefore there is liberty, the power of increaſe is exert- ed, and the ſuperabundant effects are repreſſed afterwards by want of room and nouriſhment, which is common to animals and plants, and among ani- mals by becoming the prey of others.\n\nThe effects of this check on man are more complicated. Impelled to the increaſe of his ſpecies by an equally powerful inſtinct, reaſon interrupts his career and aſks him whether he may not bring beings into the world for whom he cannot provide the means of ſubsiſtence. In a ſtate of equality, this would be the simple queſtion. In the preſent ſtate of ſociety, other con- siderations occur. Will he not lower his rank in life? Will he not ſubject himſelf to greater difficulties than he at preſent feelſ? Will he not be obliged\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nto labour harder? and if he has a large family, will his utmoſt exertions enable him to ſupport them? May he not ſee his offſpring in rags and miſery, and clamouring for bread that he cannot give them? And may he not be reduced to the grating neceſsity of forfeiting his independence, and of being oblig- ed to the ſparing hand of charity for ſupport?\n\nTheſe considerations are calculated to prevent, and certainly do prevent, a very great number in all civilized nations f rom purſuing the dictate of nature in an early attachment to one woman. And this almoſt neceſſarily, though not abſolutely ſo, produces vice. Yet in all ſocieties, even thoſe that are moſt vicious, the ten- dency to a virtuous attachment is ſo ſtrong that there is a conſtant effort an increaſe of population. towards\n\nreſtraint\n\n28\n\n29\n\nan essay on the\n\nconſtantly effort This tends to ſubject the lower claſſes of the ſociety to diſtreſs and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition.\n\nconſtant\n\nas\n\nThe way in which, theſe effects are produced ſeems to be this. We will ſubsiſtence in ſuppoſe the means of any country juſt equal to the eaſy ſup- port of its inhabitants. The conſtant effort towards population, which is found to act even in the moſt vicious ſocieties, increaſes the number of peo- ple before the means of ſubsiſtence are increaſed. The food therefore which before ſupported ſeven millions muſt now be divided among ſeven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor conſequently muſt live much worſe, and many of them be reduced to ſevere diſtreſs. The number of labourers alſo the being above the proportion of\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nwork in the market, the price of labour muſt tend toward a decreaſe, while the price of provisions would at the ſame time tend to riſe. The labourer therefore muſt work harder to earn the ſame as he did before. During this ſeaſon of diſtreſs, the diſcourage- ments to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are ſo great that population is at a ſtand. In the mean time the cheapneſs of labour, the plen- ty of labourers, and the neceſsity of an increaſed induſtry amongſt them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their to turn up f reſh ſoil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage, till ultimately the means of ſubsiſtence become in the ſame pro- portion to the population as at the period f rom which we ſet out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the reſ-\n\nland,\n\n30\n\n31\n\nan essay on the\n\ntraints to population are in ſome de- gree looſened, and the ſame retrograde progreſsive movements with and reſpect to happineſs are repeated.\n\nThis ſort of oſcillation will not be remarked by ſuperficial obſervers, and it may be difficult even for the moſt penetrating mind to calculate its peri- ods. Yet that in all old ſtates ſome ſuch vibration does exiſt, though f rom var- ious tranſverſe cauſes, in a much leſs marked, and in a much more irregu- lar manner than I have deſcribed it, no reflecting man who considers the ſub- ject deeply can well doubt.\n\nMany reaſons occur why this oſcil- lation has been leſs obvious, and leſs decidedly experience, confirmed by than might naturally be expected.\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nOne principal reaſon is that the hiſ- tories of mankind that we poſſeſs are hiſtories only of the higher claſſes. We have but few accounts that can be de- pended upon of the manners and cuſ- toms of that part of mankind where theſe retrograde and progreſsive move- ments chiefly take place. A ſatiſfactory hiſtory of this kind, on one people, and of one period, would require the conſtant and minute attention of an obſerving mind during a long life. Some of the objects of inquiry would be, in what proportion to the number of adults was the number of marriages, to what extent vicious cuſtoms pre- vailed in conſequence of the reſtraints upon matrimony, what was the com- parative mortality among the children of the moſt diſtreſſed part of the com- munity and thoſe who lived rather more at their eaſe, what were the vari- ations in the real price of labour, and\n\n32\n\n33\n\nan essay on the\n\nwhat were the obſervable differences in the ſtate of the lower claſſes of ſoci- ety with reſpect to eaſe and happineſs, at different times during a certain pe- riod.\n\nSuch a hiſtory would tend greatly to elucidate the manner in which the conſtant check upon population acts and would probably prove the exiſ- tence of the retrograde and progreſsive movements that have been mentioned, though the times of their vibrations muſt neceſſarily be rendered irregular f rom the operation of many interrupt- ſuch as the introduction ing cauſes, or failure of certain manufactures, a greater or leſs prevalent ſpirit of agri- cultural enterpriſe, years of plenty, or years of ſcarcity, wars and peſtilence, poor laws, the invention of proceſſes for ſhortening labour without the pro- portional extension of the market for\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nthe commodity, and, particularly, the difference between the nominal and labour, a circumſtance real price of which has perhaps more than any oth- er contributed to conceal this oſcilla- tion f rom common view.\n\nthe labour univerſally nominal price of falls, but we well know that it f re- quently remains the ſame, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually increasing. This is, in effect, a real fall in the price of labour, and during this period the condition of the lower orders of the community muſt gradually grow worſe and worſe. But the farmers and capitaliſts are growing rich f rom the real cheapneſs of labour. Their increaſed capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men.

But the want of f reedom in the market of labour, which occurs more or leſs in all communities, either f rom pariſh laws, or the more general cauſe of the facility of combination among the rich, and its difficulty among the poor, operates to prevent the price of labour f rom rising at the natural pe- riod, and keeps it down ſome time longer ; perhaps till a year of ſcarcity, when the clamour is too loud and the neceſsity too apparent to be resiſted.\n\nThe true cauſe of the advance in the price of labour is thus concealed, and the rich affect to grant it as an act of compaſsion and favour to the poor, in consideration of a year of ſcarci- ty, and, when plenty returns, indulge themſelves in the moſt unreaſonable of all complaints, that the price does not again fall, when a little rejection it muſt have would ſhew them that\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nriſen long before but f rom an unjuſt conſpiracy of their own.\n\nBut though the rich by unfair com- binations contribute f requently to pro- long a ſeaſon of diſtreſs among the poor, yet no poſsible form of ſociety could prevent the almoſt conſtant ac- tion of miſery upon a great part of mankind, inequality, in a ſtate of and upon all, if all were equal.\n\nif\n\nThe theory on which the truth of this position depends appears to me ſo extremely clear that I feel at a loſs to conjecture what part of it can be de- nied.\n\nincreaſe without the means of ſubsiſtence is a proposition ſo evident that it needs no illuſtration.\n\nThat population cannot\n\n36\n\n37\n\nan essay on the\n\nThat population does invariably in- creaſe where there are the means of ſubsiſtence, the hiſtory of every people that have ever exiſted will abundantly prove.\n\nthe ſuperior power of population cannot be checked without producing miſery or vice, the ample portion of theſe too bitter ingredients in the cup of human life and the con- tinuance of the physical cauſes that ſeem to have produced them bear too convincing a teſtimony.\n\nAnd that\n\nBut, in order more fully to aſcertain theſe three proposi- the validity of let us examine the different tions, in which mankind have been ſtates known to exiſt.

It is ſaid that the paſsion between the ſexes is leſs ar- dent among the North American In- dians, than among any other race of men. Yet, notwithſtanding this apathy, the effort towards population, even in this people, ſeems to be always greater it. This than the means to ſupport appears, f rom the comparatively rapid population that takes place, whenever\n\n38\n\n39\n\nan essay on the\n\nany of the tribes happen to ſettle in ſome fertile ſpot, and to draw nouriſh- ment f rom more f ruitful ſources than that of hunting ; and it has been f re- quently remarked that when an Indian family has taken up its abode near any European ſettlement, and adopted a more eaſy and civilized mode of life, that one woman has reared five, or six, or more children ; though in the ſav- age ſtate it rarely happens that above one or two in a family grow up to ma- turity. The ſame obſervation has been made with regard to the Hottentots near the Cape. Theſe facts prove the ſuperior power of population to the ſubsiſtence in nations of means of hunters, and that this power always ſhews itſelf the moment it is left to act with f reedom.\n\nIt remains to inquire whether this power can be checked, and its effects\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nkept equal to the means of ſubsiſtence, without vice or miſery.\n\nThe North American Indians, con- sidered as a people, cannot juſtly be called f ree and equal. In all the ac- counts we have of them, and, indeed, of moſt other the women are repreſented as much more completely in a ſtate of ſlavery to the men than the poor are to the rich in civilized countries. One half the na- tion appears to act as Helots to the other half, and the miſery that checks population falls chiefly, as it always muſt do, upon that part whoſe condi- tion is loweſt in the ſcale of ſociety. The infancy of man in the simpleſt ſtate requires considerable attention, but this neceſſary attention the women cannot give, condemned as they are to the inconveniences and hardſhips of f requent change of place and to the\n\nſavage nations,\n\n40\n\n41\n\nan essay on the\n\nconſtant and unremitting drudgery of preparing every thing for the reception tyrannic lords. Theſe exer- of tions, ſometimes during pregnancy or with children at their backs, muſt oc- casion f requent miſcarriages, and pre- vent any but the moſt robuſt infants f rom growing to maturity. Add to theſe hardſhips of the women the conſtant war that prevails among ſav- ages, and the neceſsity which they f re- quently labour under of exposing their aged and helpleſs parents, and of thus violating the firſt feelings of nature, and the picture will not appear very f ree f rom the blot of miſery. In eſti- mating the happineſs of a ſavage na- tion, we muſt not fix our eyes only on the warrior in the prime of life ? he is one of a hundred ? he is the gentle- man, the man of fortune, the chances have been in his favour and many ef- forts have failed ere this fortunate be-\n\ntheir\n\nprinciple of population.\n\ning was produced, whoſe guardian ge- nius ſhould preſerve him through the numberleſs dangers with which he would be ſurrounded f rom infancy to manhood. The true points of compar- iſon between two nations ſeem to be the ranks in each which appear neareſt to anſwer to each other. And in this view, I ſhould compare the warriors in the prime of life with the gentlemen, and the women, children, and aged, with the lower claſſes of the commu- nity in civilized ſtates.\n\nMay we not then fairly infer f rom this ſhort review, or rather, f rom the accounts that may be referred to of na- tions of hunters, that their population is thin f rom the ſcarcity of food, that it would immediately increaſe if food was in greater plenty, and that, putting vice out of the queſtion among ſav- ages, miſery is the check that repreſſes\n\n42\n\n43\n\nan essay on the\n\nthe ſuperior power of population and keeps its effects equal to the means of ſubsiſtence. Actual obſervation and ex- perience tell us that this check, with a few local and temporary exceptions, is conſtantly acting now upon all ſavage nations, and the theory indicates that it probably acted with nearly equal ſtrength a thouſand years ago, and it may not be much greater a thouſand years hence.\n\nOf the manners and habits that pre- vail among nations of ſhepherds, the next ſtate of mankind, we are even more ignorant than of the ſavage ſtate.

The peaceful in- habitants of the countries on which they ruſhed could not long withſtand the energy of men acting under ſuch powerful motives of exertion. And when they fell in with any tribes like their own, the conteſt was a ſtruggle for exiſtence, and they fought with a deſperate courage, inſpired by the re- jection that death was the puniſhment of defeat and life the prize of victory.\n\n46\n\n47\n\nan essay on the\n\nIn theſe ſavage conteſts many tribes muſt have been utterly exterminated.

An Alaric, an Attila, or a Zingis Khan, and the chiefs around them, might fight for glory, for the fame of extensive conqueſts, but the true cauſe that ſet in motion the great tide of northern emigration, and that continued to propel it till it rolled at different periods againſt China, Persia, Italy, and even Egypt, was a ſcarcity of food, a population extended beyond the means of ſupporting it.\n\nthe ſtandard of\n\n48\n\n49\n\nan essay on the\n\nThe abſolute population at any one period, in proportion to the extent of territory, could never be great, on ac- count of the unproductive nature of the regions occupied ; but ſome of to have been a moſt there appears rapid ſucceſsion of human beings, and as faſt as ſome were mowed down by the ſcythe of war or of famine, others roſe in increaſed numbers to ſupply their place.

But theſe inquiries are of the utmoſt importance, and a minute hiſtory of the lower Chineſe the would be of the greateſt uſe in aſcer- taining in what manner the checks to a further population operate ; what are\n\ncuſtoms of\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nthe vices, and what are the diſtreſſes that prevent an increaſe of numbers beyond the ability of the country to ſupport.\n\nin his eſſay on the popu- louſneſs of ancient and modern na- tions, when he intermingles, as he ſays, an inquiry concerning cauſes with that concerning facts, does not ſeem to ſee with his uſual penetration how very little ſome of the cauſes he al- ludes to could enable him to form any judgement of the actual population of ancient nations. If any inference can be drawn f rom them, perhaps it ſhould be directly the reverſe of what Hume draws, to ſpeak with great diffidence in diſſent- ing f rom a man who of all others on ſuch ſubjects was the leaſt likely to be deceived by firſt appearances.

On the other hand, if I find that at this period the difficul- ties attending a family were very great, that, conſequently, few early marriages took place, and that a great number of both ſexes remained single, I infer with certainty that population was at a ſtand, and, probably, becauſe the ac- tual population was very great in pro- portion to the fertility of the land and that there was ſcarcely room and food for more. The number of foot- men, houſemaids, and other perſons\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nremaining unmarried in modern ſtates, Hume allows to be rather an argument I ſhould againſt their population. rather draw a contrary inference and consider it an argument of their full- neſs, though this inference is not cer- tain, becauſe there are many thinly in- habited ſtates that are yet ſtationary in their population. To ſpeak, therefore, correctly, perhaps it may be ſaid that the number of unmarried perſons in proportion to the whole number, ex- iſting at different periods, in the ſame or different ſtates will enable us to judge whether population at theſe pe- riods was increasing, ſtationary, or de- creasing, but will form no criterion by which we can determine the actual population.\n\nThere is, however, a circumſtance taken notice of in moſt of the accounts we have of China that it ſeems diffi-\n\n58\n\n59\n\nan essay on the\n\ncult to reconcile with this reaſoning. It is ſaid that early marriages very gen- erally prevail through all the ranks of the Chineſe. Yet Dr Adam Smith ſup- poſes that population in China is ſta- tionary. Theſe two circumſtances ap- pear to be irreconcilable. It certainly the ſeems very little probable that population of China is faſt increasing. Every acre of land has been ſo long in cultivation that we can hardly con- ceive there is any great yearly addition to the average produce. The fact, per- haps, of the univerſality of early mar- riages may not be ſufficiently aſcer- tained. If it be ſuppoſed true, the only way of accounting for the difficulty, with our preſent knowledge of the ſubject, appears to be that the redun- dant occa- sioned by the prevalence of early mar- riages, muſt be repreſſed by occasional famines, and by the cuſtom of expos-\n\npopulation,\n\nneceſſarily\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nin times of ing diſtreſs, f requent is probably more than is ever acknowledged to Euro- peans. Relative to this barbarous prac- tice, it is difficult to avoid remarking, that there cannot be a ſtronger proof of the diſtreſſes that have been felt by mankind for want of food, than the exiſtence of a cuſtom that thus vio- lates the moſt natural principle of the human heart. It appears to have been very general among ancient nations, and certainly tended rather to increaſe population.\n\nchildren, which,\n\nIn examining the principal ſtates of modern Europe, we ſhall find that though they have increaſed very con- siderably in population since they were nations of ſhepherds, at preſent their progreſs is but ſlow, and inſtead of doubling their numbers every twenty-five years they require\n\nyet\n\nthat\n\n60\n\n61\n\nan essay on the\n\nthree or four hundred years, or more, for that purpoſe.

An intimate view of the ſtate of ſociety in any one country in Eu- rope, which may ſerve equally for all, will enable us to anſwer this queſtion, and to ſay that a foresight of the diffi- culties attending the rearing of a fam- ily acts as a preventive check, and the actual diſtreſſes of ſome of the low- er claſſes, by which they are diſabled f rom giving the proper food and at- tention to their children, act as a pos-\n\nin population cannot\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nitive check to the natural population.\n\nincreaſe of\n\nthe moſt one flouriſhing ſtates of Europe, may be fairly taken for an example, and the obſervations made will apply with but little variation to any other country where the population increaſes ſlowly.\n\nEngland,\n\nas\n\nof\n\nto The preventive check appears operate in ſome degree through all the ranks of ſociety in England. There are ſome men, even in the higheſt rank, who are prevented f rom marry- ing by the idea of the expenſes that they muſt retrench, and the fancied pleaſures they muſt deprive themſelves of, on the ſupposition of having a family.

This mortality among the chil- dren of the poor has been conſtantly taken notice of in all towns. It cer- tainly does not prevail in an equal de- gree in the country, but the ſubject has not hitherto received ſufficient at- tention to enable anyone to ſay that there are not more deaths in propor- tion among the children of the poor, even in the country, than among thoſe of the middling and higher claſſes.

It is a ſubject of- ten ſtarted in converſation and men- tioned always as a matter of great ſur- priſe that, notwithſtanding the im- menſe ſum that is annually collected for the poor in England, there is ſtill ſo much diſtreſs among them. Some think that the money muſt be embez- zled, others that the church-wardens and overſeers conſume the greater part of it in dinners.

But a man who ſees a little below the ſurface of things would be very much more aſtoniſhed if the fact were otherwiſe than it is obſerved to be, or even if a collection univerſally of eighteen ſhillings in the pound, inſtead of four, were materially to alter it. I will ſtate a caſe which I hope will elucidate my meaning.\n\nSuppoſe that by a ſubſcription of the rich the eighteen pence a day which men earn now was made up five ſhillings, it might be imagined, per- haps, that they would then be able to live comfortably and have a piece of meat every day for their dinners. But this would be a very falſe conclusion. The tranſfer of three ſhillings and six- pence a day to every labourer would not increaſe the quantity of meat in the country. There is not at preſent\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nenough for all to have a decent ſhare. What would then be the conſequence? The competition among the buyers in the market of meat would rapidly raiſe the price f rom sixpence or ſevenpence, to two or three ſhillings in the pound, and the commodity would not be di- vided among many more than it is at preſent. When an article is ſcarce, and cannot be diſtributed to all, he that can ſhew the moſt valid patent, that is, he that offers moſt money, becomes the poſſeſſor. If we can ſuppoſe the competition among the buyers of meat to continue long enough for a greater number of cattle to be reared annual- ly, this could only be done at the ex- penſe of the corn, which would be a very diſadvantagous exchange, for it is well known that the country could not then ſupport the ſame population, and when ſubsiſtence is ſcarce in propor- tion to the number of people, it is of\n\n74\n\n75\n\nan essay on the\n\nlittle conſequence whether the loweſt members of the ſociety poſſeſs eigh- teen pence or five ſhillings. They muſt at all events be reduced to live up- on the hardeſt fare and in the ſmalleſt quantity.\n\nIt will be ſaid, perhaps, that the in- creaſed number of purchaſers in every article would give a ſpur to productive induſtry and that the whole produce of the iſland would be increaſed. This might in ſome degree be the caſe. But fancied riches theſe the would give to population would more than counterbalance it, and the in- creaſed produce would be to be di- vided among a more than proportion- ably increaſed number of people. All this time I am ſupposing that the ſame quantity of work would be done as be- fore. But this would not really take place. The receipt of five ſhillings a\n\nſpur\n\nthat\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nday, inſtead of eighteen pence, would make every man fancy himſelf com- paratively rich and able to indulge himſelf in many hours or days of leiſure. This would give a ſtrong and immediate check to productive in- duſtry, and, in a ſhort time, not only the nation would be poorer, but the lower themſelves would be much more diſtreſſed than when they received only eighteen pence a day.\n\nclaſſes\n\nA collection f rom the rich of eigh- teen ſhillings in the pound, even if diſtributed in the moſt judicious man- ner, would have a little the ſame effect as that reſulting f rom the ſupposition I have juſt made, and no poſsible con- tributions or ſacrifices of the rich, par- ticularly in money, could for any time prevent of diſtreſs recurrence among the lower members of ſociety, changes they were.

But if I only give him money, ſupposing the produce of the country to remain the ſame, I give him a title to a larger ſhare of that produce than formerly, which ſhare he cannot re- ceive without diminiſhing the ſhares of others. It is evident that this effect, in individual inſtances, muſt be ſo ſmall as to be totally imperceptible ; but ſtill it muſt exiſt, as many other effects do, which, like ſome of the inſects that people the air, elude our groſſer per- ceptions.\n\nSupposing the quantity of food in any country to remain the ſame for many years together, it is evident that this food muſt be divided according to the value of each man’s patent *, or\n\nMr. Godwin calls the wealth that a man re- ceives f rom his anceſtors a mouldy patent.

If the rich were to ſubſcribe and give five ſhillings a day to five hundred thouſand men without retrenching their own tables, no doubt can exiſt, that as theſe men would naturally live more at their eaſe and conſume a there greater quantity of provisions, would be leſs food remaining to divide among the reſt, and conſequently each man’s patent would be diminiſhed in value or the ſame number of pieces of\n\nmay, I think, very properly be termed a patent, but I hardly ſee the propriety of calling it a mouldy one, as it is an article in ſuch conſtant uſe.\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nsilver would purchaſe a ſmaller quan- tity of ſubsiſtence.\n\nAn increaſe of population without a proportional increaſe of food will evi- dently have the ſame effect in lowering the value of each man’s patent. The food muſt neceſſarily be diſtributed in ſmaller quantities, and conſequently a day’s labour will purchaſe a ſmaller quantity of provisions. An increaſe in the price of provisions would ariſe ei- ther f rom an increaſe of population faſter than the means of ſubsiſtence, or f rom a different diſtribution of the money of the ſociety. The food of a country that has been long occupied, if it be increasing, increaſes ſlowly and regularly and cannot be made to anſw- er any ſudden demands, but variations in the diſtribution of the money of a ſociety are not inf requently occurring, and are undoubtedly among the cauſes\n\n80\n\n81\n\nan essay on the\n\nthat occasion the continual variations which we obſerve in the price of pro- visions.\n\nThe poor laws of England tend to depreſs the general condition of the poor in theſe two ways. Their firſt ob- vious tendency is to increaſe popula- tion without increasing the food for its ſupport. A poor man may marry with little or no proſpect of being able to ſupport a family in independence. They may be ſaid therefore in ſome meaſure to create the poor which they maintain, and as the provisions of the in conſequence of the country muſt, increaſed population, be diſtributed to it every man in ſmaller proportions, thoſe is evident who are not ſupported by pariſh aſsiſ- tance will purchaſe a ſmaller quantity of provisions than before and conſe-\n\nthat\n\nthe labour of\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nquently more of them muſt be driven to aſk for ſupport.\n\nSecondly, the quantity of provisions conſumed in workhouſes upon a part of the ſociety that cannot in general be considered as the moſt valuable part diminiſhes the ſhares that would oth- erwiſe belong to more induſtrious and more worthy members, and thus in the ſame manner forces more to become dependent. If the poor in the work- houſes were to live better than they now do, this new diſtribution of the money of the ſociety would tend more conſpicuouſly to depreſs the condition of thoſe out of the workhouſes by oc- casioning a riſe in the price of provi- sions.\n\nFortunately for England, a ſpirit of independence ſtill remains among the peaſantry.

A labourer who marries without being able to ſupport a family may in ſome reſpects be considered as an enemy to all his fellow-labourers.\n\nI feel no doubt whatever that the con- pariſh laws of England have tributed to raiſe the price of provisions and to lower the real price of labour. They have therefore contributed to impoveriſh that claſs of people whoſe is only poſſeſsion is their labour. It alſo difficult to ſuppoſe that they have not powerfully contributed to generate that careleſſneſs and want of f rugality obſervable among the poor, ſo con- trary to the diſposition f requently to be remarked among petty tradeſmen and ſmall farmers. The labouring poor, to uſe a vulgar expreſsion, ſeem always to live f rom hand to mouth.

Even when they have an op- portunity of ſaving they ſeldom exer- is beyond their ciſe it, but all that generally goes, preſent ſpeaking, to the ale-houſe. The poor laws of England may therefore be ſaid to diminiſh both the power and the will to ſave among the common peo- ple, and thus to weaken one of the ſtrongeſt incentives to ſobriety and in- duſtry, and conſequently to happineſs.\n\nneceſsities\n\nis a general complaint among maſter manufacturers that high wages ruin all their workmen, but it is diffi- cult to conceive that theſe men would not ſave a part of their high wages for the future ſupport of their families, inſtead of ſpending it in drunkenneſs if they did not rely and diſsipation, on pariſh aſsiſtance for ſupport in caſe\n\nIt\n\nprinciple of population.\n\nof accidents.

Whether ſuch a law would be adviſable in this country I will not pretend to deter- mine.
