Management of high-risk pregnancy is dependent on the specific etiology and situation of each particular pregnancy. Some examples of management for certain conditions include:

Diabetes: To manage diabetes, self-monitoring using finger stick blood glucose monitoring is recommended. Medical nutritional therapy and insulin therapy, as well as anti-hyperglycemic oral medications are also recommended.
Chronic hypertension: Anti-hypertensive agents that are safe to use during pregnancy should be used to manage hypertension during pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also recommends low dose aspirin in pregnant women who have chronic hypertension and other pre-eclampsia risk factors.
Congenital defects: The management of congenital defects in the fetus depends on the specific condition. For example, certain cardiac anomalies must be corrected to avoid irreversible damage during the gestational period, such as using fetal cardiac catheterization to correct pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. Spina Bifida is another common condition that can be repaired before birth. Other anomalies, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, can be monitored throughout the pregnancy and treated with surgery soon after birth.
Multiple gestations: Although conditions that are more common in multiple gestations, such as preterm birth, should be monitored properly during the pregnancy, there is currently limited evidence to evaluate the ability of specialized antenatal care on improving outcomes for the parent or infant.
Infections: Early and regular prenatal care is important. A provider should be consulted about options including prevention via medication prophylaxis or vaccines, and treatment such as appropriate use of antibiotics (ex. for congenital syphilis) or antifungals. Another option for prevention of transmission includes delivery via Caesarian delivery.
