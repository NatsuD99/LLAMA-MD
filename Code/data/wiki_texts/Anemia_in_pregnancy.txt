Common symptoms are headache, fatigue, lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, paresthesia, pallor, glossitis and cheilitis. Severe symptoms include congestive heart failure, placenta previa, abruptio placenta, and operative delivery.





The most useful test with which to render a diagnosis of anemia is a low RBC count, however hemoglobin and hematocrit values are most commonly used in making the initial diagnosis of anemia. Testing involved in diagnosing anemia in pregnant women must be tailored to each individual patient. Suggested tests include: hemoglobin and hematocrit (ratio of red blood cells to the total blood volume), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), erythrocyte count (number of red blood cells in the blood), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear to assess red blood cell morphology. If iron deficiency is suspected, additional tests such as: serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation, and plasma or serum ferritin may be warranted. It is important to note that references ranges for these values are often not the same for pregnant women. Additionally, laboratory values for pregnancy often change throughout the duration of a woman's gestation. For example, the reference values for what level of hemoglobin is considered anemic varies in each trimester of pregnancy.
-  First trimester hemoglobin < 11 g/dL
-  Second trimester hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dL
-  Third trimester hemoglobin < 11 g/dL
-  Postpartum hemoglobin < 10 g/dL
Listed below are normal ranges for important lab values in the diagnosis of anemia. Keep in mind that these ranges might change based on each patient's stage in pregnancy:
- Hemoglobin: Men (13.6-16.9), women (11.9-14.8)
- Hematocrit: Men (40-50%), women (35-43%)
- MCV: 82.5 - 98
- Reticulocyte count: Men (16-130X10^3/microL or X10^9), Women (16-98/microL or     X10^9)
Differential using MCV
MCV can be a great measure for differentiating between different forms of anemia. MCV measures the average size of your red blood cells. There are three cut off measurements for MCV. If the MCV is < 80fL it is considered microcytic. If the MCV is from 80 to 100 fL then it is considered a normocytic anemia. If the MCV is > 100 fL it is considered a macrocytic anemia. Some causes of anemia can be characterized by different ranges of MCV depending upon the severity disease.  Here are common causes of anemia organized by MCV.
MCV < 80 fL
- Iron deficiency
- Thalassemia
- Anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation
MCV 80 - 100 fL
- Iron deficiency
- Infection
- Hypothyroidism
- Liver disease or alcohol use
- Drug-induced
- Hemolysis
- Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
MCV > 100 fL
- Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
- Drug induced
- Liver disease or alcohol use
- Hypothyroidism
- Myelodysplastic Syndromes

Anemia is a very common complication of pregnancy. A mild form of anemia can be a result of dilution of blood. There is a relatively larger increase in blood plasma compared to total red cell mass in all pregnancies, which results in dilution of the blood and causes physiologic anemia . These changes take place to ensure adequate amount of blood is supplied to the fetus and prepares body for expected blood loss at the time of delivery.

For treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women, iron supplementation at doses higher than prenatal supplements is recommended. The standard doses of oral iron ranges from 40 mg to 200 mg elemental iron daily. Consult with your medical provider to determine the exact dose needed for your condition, higher than needed doses of iron supplements may sometimes lead to more adverse effects.
Iron supplements are easy to take, however adverse effects in some cases may include gastrointestinal side effects, nausea, diarrhea, and/or constipation. In cases when oral iron supplement is not tolerable, other options include longer intervals between each oral dose, liquid iron supplements, or intravenous iron. Intravenous iron may also be used in cases of severe iron deficiency anemia during second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
Anemias due to other deficiencies such as folic acid or vitamin B12 can also be treated with supplementation as well; dose may vary based on level of deficiency.
Other forms of anemias, such as inherited or acquired anemias prior to pregnancy, will require continuous management during pregnancy as well.
Treatment should target the underlying disease or condition affecting the patient.

The majority of obstetric anemia cases can be treated based on their etiology if diagnosed in time. Oral iron supplementation is the gold standard for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia and intravenous iron can be used when oral iron is not effective or tolerated from the second trimester of pregnancy onwards.
Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage is multifactorial and includes medical management, surgical management along with blood product support.
