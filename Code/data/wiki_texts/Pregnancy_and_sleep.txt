Sleep disorders are frequently experienced during pregnancy, impacting over 50% of all pregnancies. These issues tend to become more prevalent as pregnancy advances. The most commonly observed sleep disorders in pregnant women include insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has officially recognized 'pregnancy-associated sleep disorder' as a distinct condition, encompassing both insomnia and increased daytime sleepiness occurring during pregnancy.

The National Health Service (NHS) advises pregnant individuals to sleep on their side, either the left or right, for optimal safety during pregnancy. Research indicates that beyond the 28th week, assuming a supine (back) sleeping position can result in a twofold increase in the risk of stillbirth. This increased risk may be attributed to potential disruptions in fetal blood circulation and oxygen supply. Sleeping on the back can also give rise to various complications, including back pain, respiratory issues, hemorrhoidal problems, low blood pressure, gastrointestinal discomfort, and reduced blood flow to both the maternal heart and the developing fetus. Furthermore, the weight gain associated with pregnancy may heighten the likelihood of developing sleep apnea when sleeping on the back.

During pregnancy, a significant period of emotional adjustment occurs, involving thoughts, feelings, and relationships regarding oneself and the unborn child, which often find expression in dreams. Pregnant women often describe their dreams as exceptionally vivid and realistic. Some systematic studies suggest that the majority of pregnant women (67–88%) report experiencing at least one dream related to topics like pregnancy, childbirth, or babies. Additionally, some other studies indicate that 30–62% of these dreams include maternal elements, and their frequency tends to increase as pregnancy progresses. These dreams typically touch upon the mother's physical well-being and the baby's sex, but may also feature elements of danger or harm to the baby, mother, father, as well as issues within the family and marriage. Pregnant individuals tend to have better dream recall, and notably, the content of their dreams tends to be more disturbing compared to other life stages. Comparative research suggests that pregnant persons recall more dreams centered around pregnancy-related themes (e.g., childbirth, pregnancy, the fetus, their own body, the baby's body) and more elements involving potential risks to the fetus and themselves. Pregnancy can influence dream patterns, leading to an increased likelihood of experiencing bad dreams and nightmares. Pregnant women's dreams tend to be more masochistic and include more elements where they experience misfortune, harm, or face environmental threats, although they do not necessarily involve more aggressive actions.
